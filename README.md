## Projects
### Live Face Mask Detection (_June 2024_)

- Implemented a face mask detection system using Faster R-CNN, achieving high accuracy and real-time performance
- Trained the model on a dataset of annotated images, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for model development
- Evaluated the model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a detailed analysis using a confusion matrix and ROC curve
- Integrated the model with OpenCV for real-time video stream processing, enabling immediate mask detection feedback.

### Graph RAG Research Consultant (_June 2024_)
- Programmed a customized query system for large language models (LLMs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of model hallucinations when generating outputs with generative AI (GenAI).
- Constructed property graphs with extractors using Llama Index and trained a large language model (LLM) with a 1,024-dimensional embedded model using Mistral AI to address issues in understanding decision-making when identifying relevant information in the linked RAG database.
- Extracted data from the final constructed knowledge graph using retrievers to generate visual representations of specific nodes and edges, highlighting key information identified by the model when querying user input.


### Predictive Modeling in Computational Diagnosis of Coronary Heart Diseases 	(_March 2024_)
- Developed a multiple logistic regression model to predict a patient’s likelihood of a future disease diagnosis 
- Employed backward stepwise selection using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), pairwise assessment, and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values to mitigate collinearity issues resulting in a final accuracy of 73%

### Approved Loan Status Using Machine Learning Models (_December 2023_)
- Applied four classification models based on previous loans approved by Lending Club from 2012-2015 to predict future applicants’ probability of loan approval with an accuracy achieved by Naive Bayes at 94%, logistic regression at 92%, KNN at 82% and null models at 82%
- Implemented advanced feature engineering techniques such as feature selection, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction to improve the model performance

### Dataset Management and Cleaning Project (_December 2022_)
- Managed a large financial dataset to ensure data integrity and accuracy in support of fraud analysis.
- Conducted thorough analysis of the financial dataset to identify inconsistencies, outliers, and errors.
- Employed advanced data cleaning techniques to ensure the quality and accuracy of the data.
- Applied the Pandas library extensively for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
- Employed NumPy for advanced numerical operations and data manipulation.
- Implemented regex (regular expressions) for intricate pattern matching and data extraction.
- Utilized data visualization tools, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, to identify trends and anomalies visually.
