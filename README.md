## Projects
### Live Face Mask Detection 

•	Implemented a face mask detection system using Faster R-CNN, achieving high accuracy and real-time performance
•	Trained the model on a dataset of annotated images, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for model development
•	Evaluated the model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a detailed analysis using a confusion matrix and ROC curve
•	Integrated the model with OpenCV for real-time video stream processing, enabling immediate mask detection feedback.

Predictive Modeling in Computational Diagnosis of Coronary Heart Diseases 	March 2024
•	Developed a multiple logistic regression model to predict a patient’s likelihood of a future disease diagnosis 
•	Employed backward stepwise selection using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), pairwise assessment, and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values to mitigate collinearity issues resulting in a final accuracy of 73%
